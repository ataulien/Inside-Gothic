# Welcome to Inside-Gothic

In this Document, I am going to discuss the architecture of the games
_Gothic I & II_ by _Piranha Bytes_, as figured out by developing [REGoth](https://github.com/REGoth-project/REGoth)
and [REGoth-bs](https://github.com/REGoth-project/REGoth-bs).

Both games are built upon the
_zEngine_ or _ZenGin_, originally developed by a group of students
called _Mad Scientists_. If you want to know more about the development
of Gothic, I recommend the excellent series [Gothic in a
Nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuvISO5qGG8) by arhn.eu.

These texts are not meant to be a strict reference, but rather a peek
into the engines architecture and functionality for those interested to
learn more about the inner workings of the Gothic games on a higher
level.

You can edit this document on [Github](https://github.com/ataulien/Inside-Gothic).

    This is a work-in-progress.
